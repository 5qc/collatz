This is an enhanced and modern simulator for the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). With the formula given with the conjecture, it calculates and shows a graph based on any number you give.

$$
f(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{n}{2} &\text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2},\\[4px] \frac{3n+1}{2} & \text{if } n\equiv 1 \pmod{2}. \end{cases}
